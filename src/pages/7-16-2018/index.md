title: "Building a Blog with Gatsby js"
---

Over the past few months, I’ve grown tired of my old [personal site](http://will-ferens.surge.sh/) - it’s a bit overworked, extremely slow, hosted on a free static publishing site (without a fancy and impressive .com), and the code is downright messy. I built it a while ago now and it isn’t representative of what I can do now. So I blocked off a week to start from scratch on something new. I knew I wanted a blog, not only to prove I could build one, but also to keep closer track of my coding process and establish a better web presence
